# Task 1
## Project 1 - Kidzie API for Payment
### Question 1
> - 1. API with multiple connections
> - 2. Best databases for e-commerce applications
> - 3. Programming language for building APIs
> - 4. Libraries or Frameworks used to build APIs in JavaScript
### Question 2
> **Database:** FireBase, is a database developed by Google and is used by most modern applications. Furthermore, FireBase is considered to be an API Database which will work properly with Moneris to process data.<br>
> **Operating System:** Windows, since we want a portable system that will run on any environment and most environments are present in Windows because it has the largest number of users.<br>
> **Programming Language:** JavaScript (Node.JS which is a runtime platform for JavaScript), since it is a well-known programming language for building APIs and the syntax is known by nearly every developer. JavaScript is open source and can be incorporated into any system, which means that the API can be used in Web applications or mobile applications due to JS compatibility.<br>
> **Libraries:** _Express.JS, Express is primarily used to build APIs which is the best option for our case.<br>

## Project 2 - Quiet Clicks
### Question 1 
> - 1. Databases for Android applications
> - 2. Easiest Android programming language
> - 3. Kotlin’s most used libraries
> - 4. Kotlin’s Anko usage

### Question 2
> **Database:** _SQLite, is widely used in mobile applications and is open-source which means that it is free to use for commercial use.<br> 
> **Operating System:** Android, since Quiet Clicks needs to cover a large population with minimum effort invested in building the application. Unlike iOS, Android has multiple programming languages compatible to it which means a larger number of libraries. On the other hand, iOS is limited to Swift and has a small number of users compared to Android.<br>
> **Programming Language:** Kotlin, is considered to be one of the easiest programming languages and is used by beginners to build Android apps. Thus, it will take minimal effort to learn the language and build the program.<br>
> **Libraries:** Anko, which is considered to be one of the best libraries in Kotlin. The primary focus of this library is to make development easy and cleaner code.<br>

## Project 3 - Kidzie - Database for different roles

### Question 1
> - 1. Role Based database systems
> - 2. Azure programming language
> - 3. Azure systems for role-based access control.
> - 4. Secure SQL database systems.

### Question 2 
> **Database:** Azure SQL Database, since it contains many systems for role-management and is considered to be a powerful database that uses AI technology to separate between tables and understand queries perfectly.<br>
> **Operating System:** Windows, since Azure is developed by Microsoft and most functionalities are limited to Windows users.<br>
> **Programming Language:** : SQL, the software requires queries which can only be done using the structured query language.<br>
> **Libraries:** : SQL, the software requires queries which can only be done using the structured query language.
